# CodeArmy — Autonomous Software Engineering at Scale

**The Software Factory Platform for the Post-Developer Era**

*Morning Drop — February 8, 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

The software industry is at an inflection point. Today's agentic coding tools (Cursor, Copilot, Devin) help individual developers work faster. But enterprises don't want faster developers—they want **software without developers**. CodeArmy is the platform that transforms AI coding agents from productivity tools into a fully autonomous software engineering workforce.

Think of it as "AWS for AI developers"—you define what you want built, CodeArmy deploys a coordinated army of specialized AI agents to architect, code, test, deploy, and maintain it. 24/7. At 1% of the cost.

**The Vision:** Any company can ship enterprise-grade software at the speed and cost previously only available to big tech, without hiring a single engineer.

---

## The Problem

### The Developer Shortage Crisis

- **$3.4 trillion** global software market in 2026
- **85 million** developer shortage projected by 2030
- Average US developer salary: **$165,000/year** (loaded cost: **$250K+**)
- Enterprise dev teams: **18-24 months** to ship major features
- **70%** of engineering time spent on maintenance, not innovation

### Why Current AI Tools Aren't Enough

| Tool | What It Does | Limitation |
|------|--------------|------------|
| GitHub Copilot | Code completion | Still needs developers |
| Cursor | AI-assisted editing | One file at a time |
| Devin | Solo AI developer | Single agent, no orchestration |
| Replit Agent | Build simple apps | Can't handle enterprise complexity |

**The Gap:** No platform orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents to deliver **production-ready enterprise software** end-to-end.

---

## The Solution: CodeArmy

### What Is CodeArmy?

A **Software Factory Platform** that deploys and orchestrates fleets of specialized AI engineering agents to build, test, ship, and maintain software autonomously.

## The Ask

**Raising:** $8M Seed Round

**Use of Funds:**
- 50% — Engineering (platform + AI)
- 25% — Design partners + pilots
- 15% — Go-to-market
- 10% — Operations

**Target Investors:**
- a16z, Sequoia, Founders Fund, Benchmark
- Strategic: Microsoft Ventures, Google Ventures, Salesforce Ventures

---

## Conclusion

Software is eating the world. AI is about to eat software development.

CodeArmy isn't building another coding assistant—we're building the **platform that makes human software engineering optional**. The companies that adopt software factories first will have a permanent cost and speed advantage.

The developer shortage costs the global economy trillions. The solution isn't training more developers. It's deploying armies of AI agents that work 24/7, never burn out, and get better every day.

**CodeArmy: Your Software, Built by AI, Ready for Battle.**
