# QuantumShield — Post-Quantum Cryptography Migration Platform

**One-liner:** The automated platform that migrates enterprise cryptographic infrastructure to quantum-safe standards before Q-Day arrives.

**Category:** Cybersecurity / Enterprise Infrastructure  
**Date:** February 7, 2026  
**Timing:** Morning Drop

## 🎯 The Opportunity

### The Q-Day Crisis

Quantum computers capable of breaking current encryption (RSA, ECC, ECDSA) are no longer theoretical—they're arriving. Intelligence agencies estimate Q-Day (the moment quantum computers can crack current encryption) between 2028-2032. The problem? **"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later"** attacks are happening TODAY.

Adversaries are capturing encrypted data with the intention of decrypting it once quantum capabilities mature. Financial records, health data, government secrets, corporate IP—all being stockpiled for future decryption.

### The $50 Billion Problem

- **$326 trillion** in global financial assets rely on vulnerable cryptography
- **Every Fortune 500 company** must migrate to post-quantum cryptography (PQC)
- **NIST finalized PQC standards** in 2024, triggering compliance deadlines
- **US Executive Order** mandates federal systems migrate by 2035
- **EU Cyber Resilience Act** requires quantum-safe encryption for critical infrastructure

Yet most organizations have NO IDEA where their cryptographic dependencies are, let alone how to migrate them.

### Why Now?

1. **NIST Standards Finalized** — ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA standards are production-ready
2. **Compliance Clocks Ticking** — Federal mandates create hard deadlines
3. **Enterprise Awareness Peaked** — CISOs are budget-allocated but tool-starved
4. **Crypto Agility is Non-Existent** — Most enterprises can't even inventory their crypto
5. **First-Mover Window** — 18-24 months before big players catch up
