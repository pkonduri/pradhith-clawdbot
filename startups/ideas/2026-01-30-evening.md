## The One-Liner
AI receptionist that answers calls, books appointments, and takes orders for small businesses — 24/7, for $99/month.

---

## The Problem

Small businesses lose **30-40% of potential customers** because:
- Calls go to voicemail (customers hang up)
- Owner is busy with another customer
- After-hours calls = lost revenue
- Can't afford a receptionist ($3,000+/month)

**The pain is real:**
- 85% of customers won't call back if they reach voicemail
- Average missed call costs a small business $100-500 in lost revenue
- 62% of SMB calls come outside business hours

---

## The Solution

**CallFlow AI** — An AI voice agent that:
1. Answers every call in natural conversation
2. Books appointments directly into their calendar
3. Takes orders and payments
4. Answers FAQs about hours, pricing, services
5. Escalates urgent calls to the owner's cell
6. Sends call summaries via text/email

**Setup:** 10 minutes. Connect phone number, import business info, done.

## Why Now?

1. **Voice AI just got good** — ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Deepgram made natural conversation possible
2. **SMBs are desperate** — Labor costs up 30% since 2020, can't afford staff
3. **Competitors are enterprise-focused** — Bland AI, Vapi, etc. target call centers, not pizza shops
4. **COVID trained customers** — People expect digital-first, 24/7 service now
