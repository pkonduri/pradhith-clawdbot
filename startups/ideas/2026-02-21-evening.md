# Solace — The AI Mental Health Operating System

## 🧠 The Vision

**Solace is the always-available, infinitely patient AI mental health companion that democratizes access to therapeutic support for 8 billion humans.**

While therapists serve hundreds, Solace serves millions — providing 24/7 personalized mental wellness support, evidence-based interventions, and crisis prevention at a fraction of the cost.

---

## 💡 The Problem

### Mental Health is in Crisis

- **1 billion people** globally suffer from mental health disorders
- **75% of people** in low/middle-income countries receive NO treatment
- **Average wait time** for a therapist in the US: **6-8 weeks**
- **Cost barrier**: $150-300/session makes consistent care impossible for most
- **Stigma**: 60% of people with mental illness don't seek help due to shame
- **Therapist shortage**: Only 1 mental health provider per 350 people who need care

### The Status Quo is Broken

Traditional mental health care is:
- **Episodic** — 1 hour per week, if you're lucky
- **Expensive** — $600-1200/month for regular therapy
- **Inaccessible** — location, scheduling, availability constraints
- **Inconsistent** — Different therapists, different approaches
- **Reactive** — Only engaged during scheduled sessions or crises

**People are suffering in silence because the system can't scale.**
