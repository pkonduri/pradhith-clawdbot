# SynthLife — Autonomous Protein Design Intelligence

*Design any protein. For any purpose. In hours, not years.*

---

## Executive Summary

SynthLife is the autonomous AI platform for protein design. While AlphaFold predicted protein structures, we go further — we *design* novel proteins to exact specifications for any application: therapeutics, materials, agriculture, industrial enzymes. The synthetic biology market is projected to reach $85B by 2030, and protein engineering is the core technology that makes it all possible. We're building the platform that lets any company design custom proteins without a PhD in structural biology.

**The Ask:** $20M Seed to build the design engine and launch with 10 biotech partners

## The Problem

### Proteins Are Everything — But Designing Them Is Hell

Proteins are the molecular machines of life:
- **Therapeutics:** Antibodies, enzymes, gene therapies
- **Materials:** Spider silk, bio-plastics, self-healing materials
- **Agriculture:** Disease-resistant crops, nitrogen fixation
- **Industrial:** Enzymes for biofuel, food processing, carbon capture

**The design challenge is brutal:**

| Traditional Approach | Reality |
|---------------------|---------|
| Directed evolution | 2-5 years, $10M+, mostly fails |
| Rational design | Requires expert teams, low success rate |
| Computational design | Fragmented tools, no integration |
| AlphaFold | Predicts structure, doesn't *design* |

### The Gap in the Market

AlphaFold revolutionized protein structure *prediction*. But prediction isn't design:

- **Prediction:** "Here's what this existing protein looks like"
- **Design:** "Create me a protein that binds to X, is stable at Y temperature, and doesn't trigger immune response"

This is like the difference between Google Translate and GPT-4. One maps; the other creates.

### Who Feels This Pain?

1. **Pharma/Biotech** — $50B+ annual R&D spend, 90% failure rate
2. **Materials companies** — Racing to replace petroleum-based plastics
3. **Agricultural giants** — Climate change demands new crop solutions
4. **Industrial biotech** — Enzymes for green chemistry worth $15B/year
5. **Academic labs** — Brilliant ideas, no tools to execute
