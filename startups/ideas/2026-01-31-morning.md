# 🏰 Sanctuary
## AI-Native Data Sovereignty Platform

**One-line pitch:** Stripe for Data Sovereignty — one integration to make any company compliant with global data residency laws while keeping AI capabilities intact.

---

## The Opportunity

### Why Now?

**January 2026 is the inflection point:**

1. **EU is forcing the issue** — European firms are being mandated to ditch US cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) for EU-native solutions. This isn't optional anymore.

2. **EU AI Act enforcement begins** — Companies must prove AI systems comply with data handling, transparency, and risk assessment requirements.

3. **GDPR fines hit record highs** — €2.1B in fines in 2025 alone. Boards are terrified.

4. **Data localization laws spreading** — Brazil, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and 40+ countries now have data residency requirements.

5. **AI makes it worse** — Every company wants AI, but sending data to US-hosted LLMs creates compliance nightmares.

### The Problem

**Today, achieving data sovereignty is a nightmare:**

- 6-18 month migration projects
- $500K-$5M in consulting fees
- Fragmented tooling (one tool for GDPR, another for AI Act, another for migration)
- Loss of AI capabilities when moving off US clouds
- Ongoing compliance monitoring is manual and error-prone

**Companies face an impossible choice:** Stay compliant and lose AI capabilities, OR use AI and risk massive fines.

### The Solution: Sanctuary

**Sanctuary makes data sovereignty invisible.**

One SDK. One dashboard. Complete compliance.

```javascript
// Before: Compliance nightmare
const user = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [id]);
await openai.chat({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: user.email }] }); // 🚨 GDPR violation

// After: Sanctuary handles everything
const user = await sanctuary.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [id]);
await sanctuary.ai.chat({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: user.email }] }); // ✅ Data never leaves EU
```

## Why This is a Billion-Dollar Company

### 1. **Inevitable Regulatory Tailwind**
Data sovereignty laws are only getting stricter. Every new regulation expands our TAM.

### 2. **Land-and-Expand Dynamics**
Start with one compliance need (GDPR), expand to AI Act, then global data residency. Average customer grows 3x in Year 2.

### 3. **Network Effects**
More customers = better compliance templates, faster migrations, richer benchmarking data.

### 4. **Platform Lock-In**
Once data flows through Sanctuary, switching costs are enormous.

### 5. **Acquisition Target**
Every major cloud provider and enterprise software company needs this. Exit opportunities: Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, Microsoft, or IPO.

### Comparable Exits

| Company | Exit Value | Multiple | Relevance |
|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **OneTrust** | $5.3B valuation | 40x ARR | Privacy compliance |
| **Vanta** | $2.5B valuation | 50x ARR | Security compliance |
| **Snyk** | $8.5B valuation | 35x ARR | Developer security |

**Sanctuary at $150M ARR with 40x multiple = $6B valuation**
