## The Opportunity

### The Defining Challenge of Our Generation

**1.2 billion people** will be displaced by climate change by 2050. That's not a prediction — it's already happening:

- **2025:** Record 65M internally displaced people globally
- **Bangladesh:** 17M will flee coastal flooding by 2050
- **US Southwest:** Water scarcity forcing community relocations
- **Mediterranean:** Desertification driving North African migration
- **Pacific Islands:** Entire nations disappearing underwater

The economic impact is **$2.5 trillion annually** by 2030 — through destroyed property, migration costs, infrastructure rebuilding, and humanitarian crises.

### The Problem Nobody's Solving

Governments, insurers, real estate developers, and humanitarian organizations are flying blind:

- **No predictive models** connecting climate data → population movement → economic impact
- **Siloed information** — climate scientists don't talk to demographers don't talk to economists
- **Reactive, not proactive** — we rebuild after disaster instead of planning ahead
- **Political paralysis** — without data, there's no mandate to act

**The result?** Trillions in avoidable damage. Millions of preventable deaths. Communities destroyed that could have been saved.

### Why Now?

1. **Climate Tipping Points Hit** — 2025-2026 saw unprecedented compound disasters (wildfires + floods + heat domes)
2. **AI Can Finally Model Complexity** — LLMs + geospatial AI + climate models = breakthrough predictive capability
3. **Insurance Crisis** — State Farm, Allstate fleeing California/Florida; industry desperate for better risk models
4. **Government Urgency** — Biden's Climate Migration Task Force, EU Adaptation Strategy need data
5. **Satellite Revolution** — Daily global imaging at 3m resolution makes tracking possible
6. **Real Estate Repricing** — $200B+ in stranded assets needs identification before crashes

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Insurance Beachhead (Q1-Q4 2026)

**Why insurance first:**
- Acute pain point — $100B+ annual climate losses, models broken
- Concentrated market — top 20 insurers = 70% market
- Clear ROI — better pricing = immediate P&L impact
- Fast sales cycles — urgency drives decisions
- Data-rich — carriers become training data partners

**Target accounts:**
- Reinsurers: Munich Re, Swiss Re, Hannover Re, Berkshire Hathaway
- P&C leaders: State Farm (fleeing CA), Allstate, Liberty Mutual, Travelers
- Specialty: AXA XL, Chubb, FM Global
- Insurtechs: Lemonade, Hippo, Coalition

**Entry point:** Partner with catastrophe modeling firms (RMS, AIR, Verisk) — they have relationships but lack migration intelligence

### Phase 2: Financial Services Expansion (Q1-Q4 2027)

**Mortgage risk is a $13T market in the US alone:**
- Partner with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac on climate risk standards
- Sell to top 10 mortgage originators

## Competitive Landscape

### Climate Risk Analytics
| Company | Focus | Gap |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Jupiter Intelligence | Physical risk | No migration modeling |
| One Concern | Disaster response | No long-term forecasting |
| First Street Foundation | Flood risk | Limited scope |
| Four Twenty Seven | Real estate risk | Acquired by Moody's, less innovation |

### Catastrophe Modelers
| Company | Focus | Gap |
|---------|-------|-----|
| RMS (Moody's) | Insurance cat modeling | Climate models outdated |
| AIR (Verisk) | Insurance cat modeling | No demographic integration |
| CoreLogic | Property data | Climate capabilities nascent |

### Climate Intelligence
| Company | Focus | Gap |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Tomorrow.io | Weather intelligence | Short-term focus |
| Climate Engine | Earth observation | Research, not enterprise |
| Salient Predictions | Seasonal forecasting | Agricultural focus |

**Our Moat:**
1. **Multi-disciplinary fusion** — Only platform integrating climate + demographic + economic + real-time
2. **Foundation model advantage** — Purpose-built for migration prediction
3. **Government relationships** — Early partnerships create data access moat

## The Vision

### 2030: The Climate Migration Command Center

By 2030, ClimateShift is the definitive platform for climate migration intelligence:

- **Every insurance policy** priced using ShiftRisk
- **Every mortgage** assessed for long-term climate viability
- **Every city** using ShiftPlan for infrastructure decisions
- **Every disaster response** optimized by ShiftHumanitarian
- **Every investment** screened through climate migration lens

We've helped:
- **500 communities** execute managed retreat with dignity
- **$50B in assets** avoid stranding through early action
- **10 million people** relocate safely before disasters struck
- **$500B+ in damage** prevented through proactive planning

### The Longer Horizon

The climate migration crisis is the defining challenge of the 21st century. There are only two paths:

1. **Reactive chaos** — Wait for disasters, manage crises, absorb trillions in damage
2. **Proactive adaptation** — Predict, plan, and protect communities before catastrophe

ClimateShift makes path #2 possible. We're not just building a business — we're building the intelligence infrastructure for humanity's largest migration in history.

**The window is closing. The data exists. The technology is ready. The only question is: who builds this?**
