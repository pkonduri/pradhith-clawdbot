## The Problem

### Debt Is a $17.5 Trillion Crisis

1. **Overwhelming Complexity**: Average American has 4+ debt accounts across credit cards, auto loans, mortgages, student loans, and personal loans—each with different rates, terms, and optimization strategies

2. **Information Asymmetry**: Banks profit from consumer confusion. Variable rates, balance transfer traps, minimum payment psychology—all designed to maximize interest paid

3. **Emotional Paralysis**: Debt triggers shame and avoidance. 63% of Americans lose sleep over finances. Most avoid looking at the full picture

4. **Expensive "Help"**: Debt settlement companies charge 15-25% of enrolled debt. Credit counselors are underfunded. Financial advisors ignore anyone under $250K in assets

5. **Missed Opportunities**: Billions left on the table annually from unused 0% APR offers, hardship programs, negotiable rates, and strategic timing

### The Numbers Don't Lie

- **$1.13T** in credit card debt (avg 22.8% APR)
- **$1.77T** in auto loans
- **$1.59T** in student loans
- **$12.5T** in mortgages
- **Average debt per household:** $101,915
- **Interest paid annually:** $1,300+ per household just on credit cards
- **Only 34%** of Americans could handle a $1,000 emergency without debt
