# EverAfter: AI-Powered Legacy & Memory Preservation

**Tagline:** *Love stories deserve to last forever.*

**Date:** February 14, 2026 — Valentine's Day Morning Drop

---

## Executive Summary

EverAfter is an AI-native platform that transforms personal memories into interactive, living legacies. Using advanced voice cloning, video synthesis, and conversational AI, we enable families to preserve and interact with the essence of their loved ones — forever.

In a world where 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day and the "loneliness epidemic" affects 60% of Americans, EverAfter addresses the universal human need for connection, continuity, and meaning. We're not just preserving memories — we're making them immortal.

**The Opportunity:** $47B market at the intersection of estate planning ($275B), funeral services ($23B), and AI personalization ($15B projected by 2028).

---

## The Problem

### The Great Loss Crisis

Every year, 3.4 million Americans lose a parent. Within 5 years, most report their greatest regret: **not capturing enough memories, stories, and wisdom.**

- **63%** wish they had recorded more conversations with deceased loved ones
- **78%** of families have fewer than 10 minutes of video of their grandparents
- **89%** of adults say they would pay "any amount" to have one more conversation with a lost loved one

### Current Solutions Fail

| Solution | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Photo albums | Static, degrade, inaccessible to future generations |
| Video recordings | Unstructured, rarely watched, no interactivity |
| Written memoirs | Few complete them, not conversational |
| Ancestry.com | Genealogy focus, not personality/memory preservation |
| Funeral services | Transactional, not ongoing relationship |

The market is fragmented, analog, and emotionally underserved.

---

## The Solution

### EverAfter: Living Legacies

EverAfter creates **AI Memory Companions** — interactive digital representations of loved ones that preserve their:

1. **Voice** — Cloned with just 30 minutes of audio
2. **Stories** — Captured through guided AI interviews
3. **Personality** — Modeled from conversations, photos, and family input
4. **Wisdom** — Indexed and retrievable for future generations

## Ethics & Trust

### The Consent Framework

1. **Explicit Recording Consent** — Subject must verbally consent on recording

- ❌ Use memories for advertising or model training (without consent)
