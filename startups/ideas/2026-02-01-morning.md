# NeuraBio — Personalized Longevity Intelligence Platform

**The Bloomberg Terminal for Human Healthspan**

*"Your biology, decoded. Your lifespan, optimized."*

---

## Executive Summary

NeuraBio is an AI-powered longevity intelligence platform that transforms multi-omics data into actionable, personalized healthspan optimization strategies. We're building the definitive operating system for human longevity—combining genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and continuous biomarker monitoring with cutting-edge AI to give every individual a science-backed roadmap to live longer, healthier lives.

**The Pitch:** What if you could see your biological age in real-time, understand exactly which interventions work for YOUR unique biology, and have an AI continuously optimizing your healthspan like a trading algorithm optimizes a portfolio?

## The Problem

### The $4.2 Trillion Healthcare System Is Reactive, Not Proactive

1. **Medicine treats sickness, not aging** — 90% of healthcare spend goes to managing chronic diseases that could have been prevented
2. **One-size-fits-all doesn't work** — The same supplement that extends one person's life can harm another
3. **Data silos everywhere** — Your 23andMe, bloodwork, wearables, and medical records never talk to each other
4. **Information overload** — 10,000+ longevity studies published yearly; impossible for individuals to parse
5. **No feedback loops** — People try interventions with no way to measure if they're actually working

### The Longevity Gold Rush Has No Infrastructure

The longevity market is exploding:
- **$600B+ market by 2027** (growing 8.5% CAGR)
- **Billions in VC** flowing to longevity biotech (Altos Labs: $3B, Calico: $2.5B)
- **Wealthy early adopters** spending $50K-$500K/year on optimization
- **Life insurance companies** desperate for better mortality prediction

Yet there's no unified platform connecting the dots.
