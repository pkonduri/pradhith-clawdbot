# 🔐 VaultAI — Your Second Brain, Actually Private

**Drop:** Jan 31, 2026 • Test Drop
**Category:** AI / Privacy / Personal Knowledge

---

## The One-Liner
A local-first AI assistant that runs entirely on your device — your data never leaves your machine.

---

## The Problem

Everyone wants AI assistants, but:
- ChatGPT/Claude see everything you type
- Enterprises can't use AI for sensitive docs (legal, medical, financial)
- Privacy-conscious users are locked out of the AI revolution
- Data breaches expose your most personal conversations

**The fear is real:** 11% of data pasted into ChatGPT is confidential (Samsung banned it after source code leak).

---

## The Solution

**VaultAI** — A fully local AI that:
1. Runs 100% on your device (Mac, PC, phone)
2. Connects to your files, notes, emails — locally
3. Never sends data to any server
4. Open-source, auditable, trustworthy
5. Fine-tuned on YOUR data for personalized responses

**The stack:**
- Local LLMs (Llama 3, Mistral, Phi) optimized for Apple Silicon / NVIDIA
- Local vector DB (ChromaDB) for your knowledge base
- Local RAG pipeline for document Q&A
- Optional encrypted sync between YOUR devices only

---

## Why Now?

1. **Local LLMs are finally good** — Llama 3 70B rivals GPT-4 for many tasks
2. **Apple Silicon changed everything** — M3 MacBooks run 70B models smoothly
3. **Privacy regulations tightening** — GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA forcing compliance
4. **Enterprise demand exploding** — Legal/medical/finance need AI but can't use cloud
5. **Trust in Big Tech collapsing** — Users want control

---

## Market Size

- **TAM:** $50B+ (AI assistant market)
- **SAM:** $15B (privacy-conscious users + regulated industries)
- **SOM:** $2B (early adopters willing to pay for privacy)

**Target segments:**
- Lawyers, doctors, financial advisors (compliance-required)
- Executives with sensitive communications
- Journalists, activists, researchers
- Privacy-first consumers (growing fast)

---

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Approach | Gap |
|------------|----------|-----|
| ChatGPT | Cloud, sees everything | No privacy |
| Ollama | Local but CLI-only | No UX, no ecosystem |
| Jan.ai | Local but limited | Early, not enterprise-ready |
| PrivateGPT | Document Q&A only | Not a full assistant |

**Our edge:** Consumer-grade UX + Enterprise-grade privacy + Full second-brain features
