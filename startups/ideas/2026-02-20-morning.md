# AgentForge: The Stripe for AI Agents

**Date:** February 20, 2026  
**Category:** AI Infrastructure / Developer Tools  
**Stage:** Pre-Seed Ready  
**TAM:** $180B+ (Enterprise AI Software Market)

## 🎯 The Problem

Every company will deploy AI agents within 2 years. But building production-ready agents is a nightmare:

- **Reliability**: Agents fail silently, hallucinate, go off-rails
- **Observability**: No way to debug what an agent actually did
- **Cost Control**: Token usage spirals, no budgets or limits
- **Safety**: No guardrails, no human-in-the-loop, no audit trails
- **Scale**: Works in demo, breaks in production
- **Compliance**: SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA requirements unmet

The result? Companies build fragile, one-off agent systems that break in production. Engineering teams spend months on infrastructure instead of product.

## 💡 The Solution: AgentForge

**AgentForge is Stripe for AI agents.** One API to deploy, monitor, and scale production-ready AI agents.

```python
import agentforge

agent = agentforge.Agent(
    name="support-agent",
    model="gpt-4",
    tools=["zendesk", "slack", "notion"],
    guardrails=["no-pii", "no-financial-advice"],
    escalation="human-in-loop"
)

# Deploy with one line
agent.deploy()
```

**That's it.** The agent is now:
- ✅ Production-ready with automatic retries
- ✅ Observable with full trace logging
- ✅ Cost-controlled with budgets and alerts
- ✅ Safe with configurable guardrails
- ✅ Scalable with edge deployment
- ✅ Compliant with built-in audit trails

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Platform

1. **Agent Runtime**
   - Multi-model orchestration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, local)
   - Automatic fallbacks and retries
   - Edge deployment for latency-sensitive workloads
   - Stateful memory management

2. **Guardrails Engine**
   - Pre-built safety rails (PII detection, toxicity, off-topic)
   - Custom rule definition
   - Confidence thresholds with human escalation
   - Automatic output validation

3. **Observability Suite**
   - Full agent trace visualization
   - Token usage and cost analytics
   - Latency metrics and SLAs
   - Anomaly detection and alerts

4. **Tool Marketplace**
   - 100+ pre-built integrations (Salesforce, Zendesk, Slack, etc.)
   - Custom tool SDK
   - Permission sandboxing
   - Rate limiting per tool

5. **Governance Layer**
   - Role-based access control
   - Audit logging for compliance
   - Data residency controls
   - SOC2 Type II certified
