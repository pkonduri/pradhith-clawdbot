# NegotiateOS — Autonomous Negotiation Intelligence

*The AI that fights for your money.*

---

## The Vision

Every year, regular people leave **$100+ billion** on the table through poor negotiations — salaries they didn't push for, car prices they accepted, subscriptions they overpay, medical bills they never questioned. NegotiateOS is the AI agent that negotiates everything on your behalf — from your cable bill to your next job offer.

**One-liner:** NegotiateOS is the AI negotiator that fights for your money — handling salary talks, subscription cancellations, medical bills, and major purchases with superhuman precision.

## The Problem

### Why People Lose at Negotiation

1. **Emotional Vulnerability** — Fear of confrontation, rejection anxiety, and imposter syndrome
2. **Information Asymmetry** — You don't know what others pay, market rates, or leverage points
3. **Time Constraints** — Nobody wants to spend 2 hours haggling with Comcast
4. **Skill Gap** — Professional negotiators train for years; you don't
5. **Cultural Barriers** — Many find negotiation uncomfortable or "rude"

### The Scale of Loss

| Category | Avg Loss Per Person/Year | US Adults | Total Value Left |
|----------|-------------------------|-----------|------------------|
| Salary negotiations | $5,000 | 160M workers | $800B |
| Medical bills | $500 | 200M adults | $100B |
| Car purchases | $1,200 | 40M buyers/yr | $48B |
| Subscriptions | $300 | 200M households | $60B |
| Rent negotiations | $600 | 44M renters | $26B |
| **Total** | | | **$1T+** |

**The dirty secret:** Companies hire professional negotiators to take money from amateurs. It's a rigged game.

             • Service code 99285 may be downcoded to 99284
             
             Recommended strategy: Request itemization, 
             then negotiate cash-pay discount (typically 40-60%).
             
             Expected outcome: $1,800-2,200 (vs $4,500)
