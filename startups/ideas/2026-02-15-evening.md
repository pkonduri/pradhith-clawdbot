# FusionOS — Autonomous Fusion Energy Intelligence

**The AI Brain for Commercial Fusion Power Plants**

---

## Executive Summary

The fusion energy industry is at an inflection point. After decades of "30 years away," commercial fusion is now projected to reach grid-scale deployment by 2030-2035. Companies like Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Helion Energy, TAE Technologies, and Tokamak Energy have raised over $6 billion combined. Yet the software infrastructure to operate, optimize, and scale these revolutionary power plants doesn't exist.

**FusionOS** is the autonomous intelligence layer for fusion energy — an end-to-end AI platform that optimizes plasma containment, predicts disruptions before they occur, manages materials under extreme conditions, and orchestrates seamless grid integration. We're building the "Android for Fusion" — the operating system that makes commercial fusion economically viable at scale.

## The Problem

### The $10 Trillion Infrastructure Gap

Fusion power plants are the most complex machines ever built by humanity. A single SPARC-class reactor contains:
- Plasma at 100+ million degrees Celsius
- Superconducting magnets at -270°C
- Thousands of sensors generating petabytes of data daily
- Real-time control systems operating at microsecond precision
- Materials experiencing neutron bombardment unprecedented outside stars

**Current Reality:**
- **No unified software platform**: Each fusion company builds proprietary systems from scratch
- **Control systems from the 1980s**: Many facilities still use legacy SCADA systems
- **Reactive, not predictive**: Operators respond to disruptions rather than preventing them
- **$50M+ per disruption**: A single plasma disruption can cause months of downtime and tens of millions in damage
- **Grid integration nightmare**: No standardized protocols for fusion-to-grid power flow

### The Talent Bottleneck

- Only ~500 people worldwide have experience operating experimental fusion reactors
- Average age of fusion operators: 57 years old
- Commercial fusion will require 50,000+ trained operators by 2035
- Traditional 5-year training programs can't scale

### The Regulatory Void

- No established regulatory framework for commercial fusion
- NRC still applying fission-era rules to fundamentally different technology
- Operators need real-time compliance monitoring and documentation
- International licensing requires interoperable safety systems
