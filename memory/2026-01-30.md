# Daily Notes — Jan 30, 2026

## Session Summary

### Mac → EC2 Access Setup
- Set up SSH key auth from Mac to EC2
- Created SSH config alias: `ssh clawdbot`
- Installed macFUSE + sshfs-mac via Homebrew
- Mounted EC2 clawd folder to `~/clawdbot` in Finder
- Custom volume name: `Clawdbot`
- Created SETUP.md with all instructions

### Startup Idea Machine
- Set up 3x daily startup drops (8 AM, 4 PM, 8 PM ET)
- Each drop: trend research → idea → strategy → MVP build
- 11 PM daily recap of all 3 ideas
- Running log at `/home/ubuntu/clawd/startups/ideas/`

### PE Training Clarification
- Confirmed "evening stretch" = PE routine (kegels), not yoga
- Long holds: 10 reps × 10s (kegel squeeze)
- Reverse: 10 reps (reverse kegel)
- Box breathing: 5 min for relaxation
- Still only 1 session logged (Jan 26, 11 min)

### WhatsApp Integration
- Attempted to link WhatsApp — got "can't link devices" error
- Likely needs to clear old linked devices or wait for cooldown

## Questions/Topics Discussed
- EC2 vs Mac Mini for home server (EC2 wins for most cases)
- AWS free tier limits (750 hrs/month t3.micro)
- Chat history vs memory files (need to write to files to persist)
